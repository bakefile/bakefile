```shell
cargo install bakefile
```

`bake` is kind of like `make` in that it runs subprocesses but its
domain makes references to baking.

## Features:

- Each `Bakefile` is a "recipe"
- Each "recipe" declares "instructions"
- Each "instruction" can contain either "steps" or "dependencies" or both
- Uses 6 spaces for steps
- Tabs are not supported

## USAGE

```shell
bake
```
